# Second-Assignment - Human Programming Website Assignment

Your assignment is to make a website that houses your instructions from your Human Programming Exercise and the visual output. The website should be formated and use the stuff we covered in class. Here are a couple rules:

- at least 6 in structions
	- the instructions should be interesting and yield surprising outputs!
	- BE CREATIVE!

- run the instructions 3 times
	- 2 times by yourself
	- 1 time with someone else outside class

- you must make a website using the HTML stuff we learned in class:
	- p, h1
	- a, img
	- div, pre
	- ul, li
	- and more! TRY AND USE A TAG WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT (MAYBE A DIVIDER TAG?!)

- the website must show the instructions in a list along with images that were created by running the instructions and at least two html pages that link between each other.

- please try and "format" or "design" your site by just using space and the tags we learned.
